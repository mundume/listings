// Write a pair of programs, a diff and and a patch, which allow one to do this same operation, to compare two files and use the output and one of the files to produce the other file. Write them to work on the shell similarly to the POSIX manual descriptions (linked above), but you have freedom in terms of the algorithms used and the nature of the actual diff output.
// When your diff application is run on two files, it should be possible to use either file together with the diff output to produce the other. (Don't write a silly concatenating diff which simply concatenates the two files. We should be able to see that the diff output is actually the differences between the files.) using javascript
